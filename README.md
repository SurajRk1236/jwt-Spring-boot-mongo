# JWT Authentication with MongoDB

This project demonstrates the implementation of **JWT Authentication** using **MongoDB** in a backend application. It provides a secure method of authentication by generating JWT tokens, which are then used to authorize requests to protected routes.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration with JWT.
- **MongoDB Integration**: User credentials and data stored in a MongoDB database.
- **Token-Based Authorization**: Secure API endpoints with JWT authentication.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Optionally, manage refresh tokens to extend session duration.
